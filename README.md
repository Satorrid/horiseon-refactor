# Horiseon Code Refactor

This was a short project to refactor existing code for the Horiseon marketing web page. The main goal of 
rafactoring the code was to improve the accessibility and flow of the HTML code while re organzing and consolidating CSS selectors and properties. 
Any broken elements were also fixed without changing the functionality and appearance of the page.
